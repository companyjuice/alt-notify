# Introduction

This library is undergoing active development, and will be released soon (the same goes for the documentation).

This library was primarily written for use for React and Alt. It will and does not try to cover everyone's use-cases -- the reason why it is and will be kept as simple as possible.

## ES6

Currently, **{{ page.project_name }}**, like **alt** itself, is written in ES6 and transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.org).

## SemVer

Right now, this library is a work-in-progress, and will continue to have breaking changes (however follows SemVer) as long as necessary. Until `v1.0`, breaking changes will continue to bump `v0.x`. For example, `v0.4.1` and `v0.4.8` will have the same API, but `0.5.0` will have breaking changes.

# Introduction

**{{ page.project_name }}** was designed to be unopinionated to be used for almost any use-case. This means that you can use this library for your flashing notifications like Facebook's or Twitter's), or for simple alert messages, or whatever you can think of.

You can dish out the whole thing yourself, but that's tedious, right?

Here are some examples of the use-cases (Hey, nobody said that these apps use this library, aight?).

## Important Notes

**{{ page.project_name }}** is undergoing active development, and will be released soon (the same goes for the documentation).

This library was primarily written for use for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and [Alt](https://alt.js.org). It will and does not try to cover everyone's use-cases -- the reason why it is and will be kept as simple as possible.

## ES6

Currently, **{{ page.project_name }}**, like **alt** itself, is written in ES6 and transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.org).

## SemVer

![SemVer 2.0.0 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)

Right now, this library is a work-in-progress, and will continue to have breaking changes (however follows SemVer) as long as necessary. Until `v1.0`, breaking changes will continue to bump `v0.x`. For example, `v0.4.1` and `v0.4.8` will have the same API, but `0.5.0` will have breaking changes.

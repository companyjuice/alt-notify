## Supported Dependency Versions {#supported_dependency_versions_title}

The version here will be bumped only if the support dependency version changes. For example, given the scenario that `v0.1`; `v0.2`; and `v0.3` supports React `v0.13` and Alt `v0.15`, while `v0.4` supports a different version of React and Alt, only `v0.1` and `v0.4` will be noted.


| Version | React | Alt |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| v0.1 | v0.13 | 0.15 |

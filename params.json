Check the [Documentation Page](https://sourcescript.github.io/alt-notify) to get started!\r\n\r\n## Important Notes \r\n\r\n**alt-notify** is undergoing active development, and will be released soon (the same goes for the documentation).\r\n\r\nThis library was primarily written for use for React and Alt. It will and does not try to cover everyone's use-cases -- the reason why it is and will be kept as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n### SemVer ![SemVer 2.0.0 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)\r\n\r\nRight now, this library is a work-in-progress, and will continue to have breaking changes (however follows SemVer) as long as necessary. Until `v1.0`, breaking changes will continue to bump `v0.x`. For example, `v0.4.1` and `v0.4.8` will have the same API, but `0.5.0` will have breaking changes.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nAlmost everything you will need will be covered in the Documentation Page as accessibility and readability is better over there, compared to simple markdown files. This also makes the maintainers' lives easier as they docs only belong to one branch.\r\n\r\nWe will try to cover the most up-to-date changes, **however** we **may** not be able to provide documentation for older versions.\r\n\r\nCheck the [Documentation Page](https://sourcescript.github.io/alt-notify).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\n**alt-notify** Â© 2015+, Sourcescript. **alt-notify** is released under the [MIT](mit-license.org) license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
